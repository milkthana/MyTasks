# MyTasks

Simple to do app project which belong to ITCS424_Wireless and Mobile Computing

# Overview

Due to Covid-19, people are force to work from their home. Depending on the person working from home could be a detrimental to their productivity or it does not affect them at all. People would need a reminder or a to do list in order for them to organize their works and know which tasks is more important. Our application is to create a to do list for those who need an organizer to help with their daily life. The main feature of the application is to create to do lists, which the users will receive a notification. The users can remove an unimportant task from their to do list at any time. Finally, in order to keep track of their work progress, the calendar feature will be implemented as well.

# Purpose

The purpose of our project is to present a solution to those have a problem with organizing their daily work and study life. Especially those who are force to work from home suddenly due to the pandemic. This groups usually have problems prioritize their works, because of what they use to suddenly change and they can not adapt it as easily as some people. Our goal of our project is to solve the problem of those who is our target customer.

# UI

At first, we tried to implement the task lists but we are unable to make it work, so instead we design the first page which will be our home page. Furthermore, because of our difficulty at the moment we decided that it would be for the best that we keep our design simple at the moment. Because of that we choose to reduce one calendar with to do lists.

This is the new version of our MyTasks first and only page. The selected date would be the light green color and the another will show the today date. 
The user can swipe up to add more tarks.
